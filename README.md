**"At some point a particularly remarkable molecule was formed by
accident."**

In this sketch, I want to simulate the beginning of the life. The rules are as follows:


* Each cell has a size and a division rate that force the cell to divide every X seconds.
* Bigger cells move slow but can store more food, smalls cells are faster but have less food capacity.
* When a cell can't store more food it divides.
* The cells need to eat constantly, otherwise they dead.
* The cells can't eat other cells! This is not agar.io. 


Each time a cell divides, there is a possibility that a mutation appear, which will have diferent color and similar characteristics.

To simulate external factors, the amount of food that is generated every second varies sinusoidally, a complete cycle takes about 10 minutes. Only the adapted cells will survive.

"As mis-copyings were made and propagated, the primeval soup
became filled by a population not of identical replicas, but of several
varieties of replicating molecules, all 'descended' from the same
ancestor. Would some varieties have been more numerous than
others? Almost certainly yes."
